<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Last updated: February 6, 2026</p>

<p>TrumpAccount ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile application developed by Terror LLC that helps families track and project 530A children's savings account contributions. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

<h2>Important Notice</h2>
<p>TrumpAccount is an independent third-party application. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the United States government, the Internal Revenue Service, or any government agency.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>TrumpAccount is designed with privacy in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Children's Information:</strong> Names and dates of birth that you enter for your children are stored locally on your device with file-level encryption. If you sign in, names and dates of birth (but NOT SSN data) may be synced to our secure cloud service.</li>
  <li><strong>SSN Last 4 Digits:</strong> If you optionally provide the last 4 digits of a child's Social Security Number, this data is stored <strong>only on your device</strong>. It is never transmitted to any server, cloud service, or third party.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> Contribution amounts, dates, and types are stored locally with encryption. If signed in, contributions may be synced to the cloud.</li>
  <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you sign in with Apple, we receive your Apple-provided user identifier and optionally your email address.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> Purchase and subscription status is managed through Apple's StoreKit. We do not have access to your payment details.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We do not collect full Social Security Numbers</li>
  <li>We do not transmit SSN data (even partial) to any server</li>
  <li>We do not collect location data</li>
  <li>We do not collect usage analytics or tracking data</li>
  <li>We do not use advertising or ad tracking</li>
  <li>We do not collect bank account or financial institution information</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

  <li>To sync your data across devices when signed in (excluding SSN data)</li>
  <li>To manage your subscription status and provide premium features</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children's Data (COPPA)</h2>
<p>TrumpAccount stores information about children (names and dates of birth) as entered by their parent or guardian. We do not collect information directly from children. The parent or guardian is responsible for all data entered into the app. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without parental consent.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Cloud database and authentication for optional account sync. Data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest. SSN data is never sent to Supabase. See <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">Supabase's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Apple StoreKit:</strong> Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple. See <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Sign in with Apple:</strong> Authentication is handled by Apple. We only receive the information you choose to share.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>All app data is stored locally on your device with iOS Complete File Protection encryption. If you sign in, non-sensitive data is synced to Supabase servers using encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS). SSN data remains exclusively on your device. If you delete the app without an account, all locally stored data is permanently removed.</p>

<h2>Account Deletion</h2>
<p>You can delete your account and all associated cloud data at any time from the Settings screen within the app.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal or financial information with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.</p>
