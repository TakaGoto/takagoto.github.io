<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

<p>Murder Board ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile application developed by Terror LLC that provides AI-powered murder mystery detective game experiences. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Murder Board is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Game Progress:</strong> Your case history, investigation notes, interrogation transcripts, achievements, and game statistics are stored locally on your device and synced via iCloud. This data is never transmitted to our servers except for AI-powered interrogation features (see below).</li>
  <li><strong>AI Interrogation Data:</strong> When you interrogate suspects, your questions and the AI-generated responses are processed through our secure Supabase backend using Anthropic's Claude API. These conversations are temporarily processed to generate contextual suspect responses and are not stored long-term or used for AI training.</li>
  <li><strong>Daily Mystery Cases:</strong> Daily mystery cases are generated server-side using AI and delivered to your device. No personal information is required to receive these cases.</li>
  <li><strong>iCloud Sync:</strong> If you enable iCloud on your device, your game progress (cases, notes, stats) is automatically synced across your Apple devices using Apple's iCloud service. We do not have access to this data.</li>
  <li><strong>Anonymous Analytics:</strong> We collect anonymous usage data to improve app stability and performance. This includes a randomly generated device identifier, device model, operating system version, app session duration, screen views, and crash/error reports. This data is not linked to your identity and cannot be used to identify you personally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or any account information</li>
  <li>We do not collect location data</li>
  <li>We do not collect camera or photo data</li>
  <li>We do not collect personally identifiable analytics — all usage data is anonymous and cannot be linked to your identity</li>
  <li>We do not use advertising or ad tracking</li>
  <li>We do not store interrogation conversations long-term or use them for AI model training</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To generate contextual AI-powered suspect responses during interrogations</li>
  <li>To deliver daily mystery cases to your device</li>
  <li>To sync your game progress across your Apple devices via iCloud</li>
  <li>To improve app stability and performance through anonymous analytics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Backend infrastructure for AI interrogation features and daily case delivery. Interrogation data is processed in real-time and not stored long-term. See <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">Supabase's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Anthropic Claude:</strong> AI language model used to generate suspect interrogation responses. Conversations are processed ephemerally and not used for model training. See <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy">Anthropic's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Apple iCloud:</strong> Game progress sync across your devices (optional). See <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>Game progress data (cases, notes, stats) is stored locally on your device and optionally synced via iCloud. Interrogation questions and responses are processed in real-time through our secure backend and are not stored long-term. Anonymous analytics data is stored securely on our infrastructure. If you delete the app, all locally stored data is removed.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. Data is only shared with the third-party services listed above as necessary to provide app functionality (AI interrogations and daily case delivery).</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>We use industry-standard security measures including encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) for all network communication with our backend and third-party services. Interrogation data is processed over secure connections and not retained long-term.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Murder Board is rated 12+ for mild violence and mature themes. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
