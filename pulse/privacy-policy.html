<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Last updated: February 10, 2026</p>

<p>Pulse ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile application developed by Terror LLC that provides habit tracking and streak monitoring. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Pulse is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> If you subscribe to Pulse Premium, purchase and subscription status is managed through RevenueCat and Apple's in-app purchase system. We do not have access to your payment details.</li>
  <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Your settings, habits, completion history, and streak data are stored locally on your device using on-device storage. This data is never transmitted to our servers.</li>
  <li><strong>Notification Permission:</strong> Pulse may request permission to send local notifications for daily habit reminders. Notification tokens are managed locally on your device and are not sent to any server.</li>
  <li><strong>Anonymous Analytics:</strong> We collect anonymous usage data to improve app stability and performance. This includes a randomly generated device identifier, device model, operating system version, app session duration, screen views, and crash/error reports. This data is not linked to your identity and cannot be used to identify you personally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or any account information</li>
  <li>We do not collect location data</li>
  <li>We do not collect personally identifiable analytics — all usage data is anonymous and cannot be linked to your identity</li>
  <li>We do not use advertising or ad tracking</li>
  <li>We do not collect any health or fitness data</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To manage your subscription status and provide premium features</li>
  <li>To store your habits, streaks, and preferences locally on your device</li>
  <li>To send local notifications for habit reminders, if you have granted permission</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Subscription and in-app purchase management. RevenueCat may collect anonymous purchase data. See <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Apple In-App Purchases:</strong> Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple. See <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Anonymous analytics and crash reporting infrastructure. See <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">Supabase's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>All app data (settings, habits, completion history, streak data, preferences) is stored locally on your device. We do not store your personal app data on our servers. Anonymous analytics data is stored securely on our infrastructure. If you delete the app, all locally stored data is removed.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. Data is only shared with the third-party services listed above as necessary to provide app functionality.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>We use industry-standard security measures including encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) for any network communication with third-party services.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Pulse is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
