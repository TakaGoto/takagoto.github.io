<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Last updated: February 24, 2026</p>

<p>ShotNotes ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile application developed by Terror LLC that helps photographers convert voice memos into structured session data, deliverables, and invoices using AI. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>ShotNotes is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Voice Recordings:</strong> Audio recordings are captured and stored locally on your device. Recordings are transcribed on-device using Apple's Speech Recognition framework. Audio files are never uploaded to our servers.</li>
  <li><strong>Transcripts:</strong> When you use the AI extraction feature, your voice memo transcript (text only, not audio) is sent to our secure server for AI analysis to extract structured session data. Transcripts are processed in real-time and are not stored on our servers after analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Session Data:</strong> Client information, time entries, deliverables, follow-ups, and invoices you create are stored locally on your device using on-device storage. This data is never transmitted to our servers.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> If you subscribe to ShotNotes Premium, purchase and subscription status is managed through Apple's StoreKit and in-app purchase system. We do not have access to your payment details.</li>
  <li><strong>Device Identifier:</strong> A randomly generated anonymous device identifier is used solely for rate limiting to prevent abuse of the AI extraction service. This identifier cannot be used to identify you personally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We do not upload or store your audio recordings on our servers — transcription happens on-device</li>
  <li>We do not collect location data</li>
  <li>We do not use advertising or ad tracking</li>
  <li>We do not collect personally identifiable analytics</li>
  <li>We do not store your transcripts on our servers after AI processing</li>
  <li>We do not have access to your client contact information — it stays on your device</li>
  <li>We do not collect any health or fitness data</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To record and transcribe voice memos on-device</li>
  <li>To analyze transcripts using AI and extract structured session data (client info, time entries, deliverables, follow-ups)</li>
  <li>To generate invoices and PDF exports locally on your device</li>
  <li>To manage your subscription status and provide premium features</li>
  <li>To enforce rate limits and prevent abuse of the AI service</li>
</ul>

<h2>AI Processing</h2>
<p>When you use the AI extraction feature, only the text transcript (not the audio recording) is sent to our Cloudflare Worker proxy server, which forwards it to an AI model (Anthropic Claude) for analysis. The transcript is processed in real-time and is not retained by our servers or by Anthropic after the response is generated. The AI analysis is used solely to extract structured data from your session notes.</p>

<h2>Microphone Usage</h2>
<p>ShotNotes requires microphone access to record voice memos during or after photography sessions. Audio is recorded locally and transcribed on-device using Apple's Speech Recognition. Your audio data never leaves your device — only the resulting text transcript is sent for AI processing when you explicitly request extraction.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Apple StoreKit:</strong> Subscription and in-app purchase management. Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple. See <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Apple Speech Recognition:</strong> On-device voice transcription. Audio is processed locally on your device. See <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Anthropic (Claude AI):</strong> AI-powered transcript analysis and data extraction. Transcripts are processed in real-time and not retained. See <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy">Anthropic's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Cloudflare:</strong> Secure API proxy infrastructure. See <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">Cloudflare's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>All app data (recordings, transcripts, client information, session data, invoices, preferences) is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. We do not store your personal or business data on our servers. If you delete the app, all locally stored data is removed.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal or business information with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. Transcript text is only shared with AI services as necessary to provide the data extraction feature, and is not retained after processing.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>We use industry-standard security measures including encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) for all network communication. Your business data stays on your device and is protected by your device's built-in security features.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>ShotNotes is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the date at the top of this page.</p>
