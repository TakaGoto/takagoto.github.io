<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Last updated: February 9, 2026</p>

<p>Punchcard ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile application developed by Terror LLC that helps hourly workers track shifts, hours, and earnings. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Punchcard is designed with privacy as a core principle. All your data stays on your device:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> If you subscribe to Punchcard Pro, purchase and subscription status is managed through RevenueCat and Apple's in-app purchase system. We do not have access to your payment details.</li>
  <li><strong>App Data:</strong> Your jobs, shifts, hours, earnings calculations, and app preferences are stored locally on your device using on-device storage. This data is never transmitted to our servers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or any account information — no sign-up is required</li>
  <li>We do not collect location data</li>
  <li>We do not collect usage analytics or tracking data</li>
  <li>We do not use advertising or ad tracking</li>
  <li>We do not collect any financial, tax, or employment data beyond what you enter locally</li>
  <li>We do not transmit your shift or earnings data to any server</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To manage your subscription status and provide premium features</li>
  <li>To store your jobs, shifts, and preferences locally on your device</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Subscription and in-app purchase management. RevenueCat may collect anonymous purchase data. See <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Apple In-App Purchases:</strong> Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple. See <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>All app data (jobs, shifts, hours, earnings, preferences) is stored locally on your device. We do not operate servers that store your personal data. If you delete the app, all locally stored data is removed.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. Data is only shared with the third-party services listed above as necessary to provide app functionality.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>We use industry-standard security measures including encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) for any network communication with third-party services.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Punchcard is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
