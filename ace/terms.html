<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<p class="date">Last updated: January 28, 2026</p>

<p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Ace mobile application ("Ace" or "the app"), developed and operated by Terror LLC ("we", "us", or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using Ace, you agree to these Terms.</p>

<h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
<p>Ace is an AI-powered tool that provides pre-grade estimates for collectible trading cards. The app uses artificial intelligence to analyze photographs of cards and generate condition assessments and predicted grades.</p>

<h2>2. AI Disclaimer</h2>
<p><strong>Pre-grade estimates provided by Ace are for informational purposes only.</strong> They are not official grades and should not be relied upon as guarantees of any official grading outcome. Ace is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by PSA, BGS, CGC, or any other grading company. AI analysis may contain errors, and actual grades from professional grading services may differ from Ace's estimates.</p>

<h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>You agree to use Ace only for its intended purpose of evaluating trading card conditions. You may not:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the app</li>
  <li>Use the app to misrepresent card conditions for fraudulent purposes</li>
  <li>Attempt to circumvent subscription or usage limits</li>
  <li>Use automated systems to access the app or its services</li>
  <li>Redistribute or resell grading results commercially without permission</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
<p>Ace offers a free tier with limited daily scans and a Premium subscription with additional features. Subscriptions are billed through Apple's in-app purchase system and managed via RevenueCat. By subscribing, you agree to the pricing displayed at the time of purchase. Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your Apple ID settings.</p>

<h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All content, features, and functionality of Ace, including but not limited to the AI grading algorithms, user interface, and branding, are owned by Terror LLC and protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. Card images you upload remain your property, but you grant us a limited license to process them for grading analysis.</p>

<h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Terror LLC shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of Ace, including but not limited to losses resulting from reliance on AI-generated grades, submission decisions based on Ace estimates, or any inaccuracy in grading predictions.</p>

<h2>7. Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Ace is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the app will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that grading estimates will be accurate.</p>

<h2>8. Termination</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to Ace at any time, with or without cause, including for violation of these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the app ceases immediately. You may also delete your account at any time by contacting us.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. Changes will be reflected by updating the date at the top of this page.</p>

<h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
