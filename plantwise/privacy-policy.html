<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Last updated: February 24, 2026</p>

<p>Plantwise ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile application developed by Terror LLC that uses AI to help identify and diagnose plant health issues. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Plantwise is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Plant Photos:</strong> When you use the diagnosis feature, your plant photo is sent to our secure server for AI analysis. Photos are processed in real-time and are not stored on our servers after analysis is complete.</li>
  <li><strong>Diagnosis History:</strong> Your diagnosis results, plant photos, and treatment plans are stored locally on your device using on-device storage. This data is never transmitted to our servers unless you initiate a new diagnosis.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> If you subscribe to Plantwise Premium, purchase and subscription status is managed through Apple's StoreKit and in-app purchase system. We do not have access to your payment details.</li>
  <li><strong>Device Identifier:</strong> A randomly generated anonymous device identifier is used solely for rate limiting to prevent abuse of the diagnosis service. This identifier cannot be used to identify you personally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or any account information</li>
  <li>We do not collect location data</li>
  <li>We do not use advertising or ad tracking</li>
  <li>We do not collect personally identifiable analytics</li>
  <li>We do not store your plant photos on our servers after diagnosis processing</li>
  <li>We do not collect any health or fitness data</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To analyze plant photos and provide AI-powered diagnosis results</li>
  <li>To manage your subscription status and provide premium features</li>
  <li>To enforce rate limits and prevent abuse of the service</li>
  <li>To store your diagnosis history and treatment plans locally on your device</li>
</ul>

<h2>AI Processing</h2>
<p>When you submit a plant photo for diagnosis, the image is sent to our Cloudflare Worker proxy server, which forwards it to an AI model (Anthropic Claude) for analysis. The image is processed in real-time and is not retained by our servers or by Anthropic after the response is generated. The AI analysis is used solely to provide you with plant health diagnosis and treatment recommendations.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Apple StoreKit:</strong> Subscription and in-app purchase management. Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple. See <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Anthropic (Claude AI):</strong> AI-powered plant diagnosis. Plant photos are processed in real-time and not retained. See <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy">Anthropic's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Cloudflare:</strong> Secure API proxy infrastructure. See <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">Cloudflare's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>All app data (diagnosis history, plant photos, treatment plans, preferences) is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. We do not store your personal app data on our servers. If you delete the app, all locally stored data is removed.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. Plant photos are only shared with AI services as necessary to provide the diagnosis feature, and are not retained after processing.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>We use industry-standard security measures including encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) for all network communication. Plant photos are transmitted securely and are not stored after processing.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Plantwise is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the date at the top of this page.</p>
