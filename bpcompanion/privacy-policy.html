<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Last updated: February 6, 2026</p>

<p>BP Companion ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile application developed by Terror LLC that helps users track and monitor blood pressure readings. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>BP Companion is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Blood Pressure Readings:</strong> Your systolic, diastolic, and pulse readings, along with timestamps and optional notes, are stored locally on your device with file-level encryption. If you choose to sign in, readings may be synced to our secure cloud service (Supabase) to enable cross-device access.</li>
  <li><strong>HealthKit Data:</strong> With your explicit permission, BP Companion can read and write blood pressure data from Apple Health. This data is handled in accordance with Apple's HealthKit guidelines and is never shared with third parties or used for advertising.</li>
  <li><strong>Medication Information:</strong> Any medications you track are stored locally on your device. If signed in, they may be synced to the cloud.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> If you subscribe to BP Companion Premium, purchase and subscription status is managed through Apple's StoreKit. We do not have access to your payment details.</li>
  <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you sign in with Apple, we receive your Apple-provided user identifier and optionally your email address. We do not receive your Apple ID password.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We do not collect location data</li>
  <li>We do not collect usage analytics or tracking data</li>
  <li>We do not use advertising or ad tracking</li>
  <li>We do not sell or share your health data with any third party</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To display your blood pressure trends, insights, and statistics</li>
  <li>To sync your data across devices when signed in</li>
  <li>To manage your subscription status and provide premium features</li>
  <li>To store your preferences locally on your device</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apple HealthKit</h2>
<p>BP Companion requests access to read and write blood pressure and heart rate data in Apple Health. This access is entirely optional and requires your explicit permission. HealthKit data is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Never used for advertising or marketing</li>
  <li>Never sold to third parties</li>
  <li>Never shared with third parties except as displayed within the app</li>
  <li>Handled in full compliance with Apple's HealthKit guidelines</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Cloud database and authentication for optional account sync. Data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest. See <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">Supabase's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Apple StoreKit:</strong> Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple. See <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Sign in with Apple:</strong> Authentication is handled by Apple. We only receive the information you choose to share.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>All app data is stored locally on your device with iOS Complete File Protection encryption. If you sign in, data is synced to Supabase servers using encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS). Data at rest on Supabase is encrypted. If you delete the app without an account, all locally stored data is permanently removed.</p>

<h2>Account Deletion</h2>
<p>You can delete your account and all associated cloud data at any time from the Settings screen within the app. Local data can be cleared separately.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal or health information with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.</p>
